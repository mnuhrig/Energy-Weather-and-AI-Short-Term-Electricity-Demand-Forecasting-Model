## Abstract
<p align="justify">
The province of Entre Ríos (Argentina) lacks an automated model for electricity demand forecasting, which would notably enhance its management and daily operations. Accurate prediction remains a challenge due to the non-linear nature of electricity consumption. This work addresses this challenge using deep learning techniques with demonstrated success in time series prediction and growing applications in energy forecasting. We propose an LSTM-based model for short-term electricity demand forecasting using a recurrent neural network (LSTM) capable of capturing temporal dependencies without manual feature extraction. The model takes as input a combination of meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, humidity) and energy-related variables (e.g., historical demand, time of day) to predict electricity demand. We evaluated various temporal window configurations and other hyperparameters to assess their impact on predictive performance. Results demonstrate that the LSTM model effectively captures temporal dependencies, providing accurate demand forecasts compared to classical methods. This study highlights the potential of deep learning for optimizing energy system operations and supporting decision-making in power management.
